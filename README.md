Use LSTM model to predict covid daily cases in the US

Currently simple lstm was trained and tested on US data.

future steps:
1) hyperparameter tuning on lstm model.
2) use data of another country (prefer an European country ex France since previous COVID waves hit Europ earlier than US) to do transfer learning.
3) continue to build a baseline model using traditional time series techniques such as ARIMA.
